        <h1 style=font-size:5vw class="title">Books Every Gardener Should Read </h1>
        <p>Unless you're lucky enough to be surrounded by knowledgeable gardeners-whether they are parents, friends, or neighbors-you can often find yourself with your very first garden and very little idea of how to care for it (let alone how to design it, replant it, or start entirely from scratch).<br>
            A really great book can help; think of it as a mentor. While it's impossible to write the definitive list of must-read books for gardeners (we could have easily doubled or tripled this list), weve rounded up the books we return to for gardening wisdom and inspiration. Some of these books are many decades old, but their advice still holds true.</p>
