                    <p>
                        We aim to develop a Web application that provides support for interactive learning of concepts and activities specific to gardening. For each specific concept / tool, we will provide the user with information such as meaning, type, practical advice, context of use, plus suggestions on when to perform activities, such as, sowing, irrigation, etc. The system will monitor the progress made by each user in the learning process, providing the user with several structure tests on 3 levels: easy, medium and heavy. Each user must first pass the entire level easily, to have access to the intermediate level, and respectively at the difficult level. Each test will be based on the information present on the web page. Only the one who has mastered all the information well can successfully pass all the levels. It will also generate a ranking of the top 10 most diligent users, also available as an RSS feed, which will be based on the number of points accumulated after taking the tests.

        <li>HTML5 - is a language for structuring and presenting content for the World Wide Web, a core Internet technology originally proposed for Opera software.</li>
        <li>CSS - (Cascading Style Sheets) is a standard for formatting elements of an HTML document. Styles can be attached to HTML elements through external files or within the document, through the "style" element and / or the style attribute. CSS can also be used to format XHTML, XML and SVGL elements</li>
        <li>PHP - Hypertext Preprocessor. Originally used to produce dynamic web pages, it is widely used in the development of web pages and applications. It is mainly used embedded in HTML code, but from version 4.3.0 it can also be used in "command line" mode (CLI), allowing the creation of standalone applications. It is one of the most important open-source and server-side web programming languages, with versions available for most web servers and all operating systems. According to statistics, it is installed on 20 million websites and 1 million web servers. It is available under the PHP License and the Free Software Foundation considers it to be free software.</li>
